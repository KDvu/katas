## Java Binary Tree + Tree Traversal Practice

Practice with JUnit 5 to implement a Binary Tree, Depth-First Search (In-order, Pre-order and Post-order) and Breadth-First Search

All methods for the binary tree operations can be found in the [Tree class](https://github.com/KDvu/katas/blob/master/java/binary_trees/src/main/java/Tree.java), the methods to implement are also in the Tree class after [line 100](https://github.com/KDvu/katas/blob/master/java/binary_trees/src/main/java/Tree.java#L100)  

Tests can be found in the [test directory](https://github.com/KDvu/katas/tree/master/java/binary_trees/src/test/java)
